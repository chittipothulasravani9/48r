  <h2>1. What is HTML?</h2>
  <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It structures web content and is the foundation of all websites on the internet.</p>

  <h2>2. What are semantic HTML elements?</h2>
  <p>Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Examples include &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt;.</p>

  <h2>3. What is the difference between &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;?</h2>
  <p>&lt;div&gt; is a block-level element used for grouping larger chunks of content, while &lt;span&gt; is an inline element used for styling small parts of text or elements within a line.</p>

  <h2>4. What is the purpose of the &lt;DOCTYPE&gt; declaration?</h2>
  <p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It helps the browser render the page correctly.</p>

  <h2>5. What are void elements in HTML?</h2>
  <p>Void elements are self-closing HTML elements that do not require a closing tag. Examples include &lt;img&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, &lt;hr&gt;, and &lt;input&gt;.</p>

  <h2>6. What is the difference between id and class in HTML?</h2>
  <p>The <code>id</code> attribute is used to uniquely identify a single element on a page, while the <code>class</code> attribute is used to group multiple elements for styling or scripting.</p>

  <h2>7. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?</h2>
  <p>You create a hyperlink using the &lt;a&gt; tag. Example: &lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

  <h2>8. What is the purpose of the &lt;meta&gt; tag?</h2>
  <p>The &lt;meta&gt; tag provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding, author, description, and viewport settings for responsive design.</p>

  <h2>9. What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2>
  <p>HTML is more forgiving with syntax errors, while XHTML is stricter and based on XML, requiring well-formed code with properly closed tags and case sensitivity.</p>

  <h2>10. What is the role of the &lt;alt&gt; attribute in images?</h2>
  <p>The <code>alt</code> attribute provides alternative text for an image if it cannot be displayed. It also improves accessibility for screen readers and contributes to SEO.</p>
